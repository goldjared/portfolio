<p>Hello world! It's currently 12:36AM. I'm working on this website, because I wanted to work on something. Here is my first writing on the site. I didn't want to call it a blog. Probably, I'll regret creating this with vanilla HTML, but, here's to keeping things simple.</p>
<br />
<p>Now about half an hour has passed. I've had a second thought on this post, and I'd like to better capture the moment in time. The mix that is keeping me company tonight is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcr9rFjV8cY&list=PLkNamCmOgQP_FVoXMZ5UWDRMOH4jl-0xX&index=11">DnB mix</a>, it's not often I'll listen to the DnB mixes, but from time to time I enjoy them.</p> 
<br/>
<p>Currently, I'm in my 2nd semester of a computer science degree. In school, my focus at the moment is primarily on OOP in Java, next semester it will be on data structures. Outside of school, I feel like there is too much to study. Lately, there are so many choices, that I find myself not picking any. Moving forward, I'm going to stick to a set core. That core consisting of DSA/leetcode, full stack development, and wherever my interests take me - I'm willing to explore.</p>
<br/><p>I've done some leetcode, but I think I need to dig deeper into the DSA more. Ideally, every morning for 1-2 hours I will work on this area. The gym should follow, or some form of exercise. Finishing up the core will be full stack development.</p>
 <br />
<p>Following this concise core program, I should reach my goals so long as I stay consistent. Also, moving forward, I’ll be typing my writings up in a word processor. Because editors are great for code, but I’m now finishing/cleaning up the mess from the editor in a word processor. Would you use a boiling pot of water to make your coffee, or a coffee maker?</p>
