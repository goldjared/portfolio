  <p>Hello world! It's currently 12:36AM. I'm working on this website, because I wanted to work on something. Here is my first post on the site. I didn't want to call it a blog. Probably, I'll regret creating this with vanilla HTML, but, here's to keeping things simple.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Currently, I'm in my 2nd semester of a computer science degree. In university, my focus is primarily on OOP in Java, next semester it will be data structures. Outside of university, I’ve been grinding. CS is interesting since there's school and there's “your school".  Lately, there are so many choices in the later, that I find myself not picking any. Do I work with Ruby/Rails, Java/Spring, or Node/Express? I’ll have to make a decision soon. Moving forward, I'm going to stick to a core consisting of DSA/leetcode, full stack development, and wherever my interests take me - I'm willing to explore. </p>
  <br />
  <p>Following this concise core program, I should reach my goals so long as I stay consistent. Also, moving forward, I’ll be typing my writings up in a word processor. Because editors are great for code, but I’m now finishing/cleaning up the mess from the editor in a word processor. Would you use a boiling pot of water to make your coffee, or a coffee maker?</p>
